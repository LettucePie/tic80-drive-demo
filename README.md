# Drive Demo #

This is my attempt at making a classic retro-style 3D driving game. This will not only force me to learn using the limitations presented with TIC-80, but also confront the magic that is 3D Graphics on a 2D screen.

## Guides ##

At first I only used TIC-80's "Learn" page. I figured if I can just rotate and stretch a sprite, I can make a psuedo 3D effect. I still believe this will be effective, however I'm going to try to learn from others... 

Now I'm referring to "btco" guide to making a 3D FPS engine in TIC-80: https://medium.com/@btco_code/writing-a-retro-3d-fps-engine-from-scratch-b2a9723e6b06

I'm also referring to an old version of their 3D Drawing script. I hope that by building it myself and incrementing the updates that btco did (thank you version history) I can better understand the process. The Project can be found here: https://github.com/btco/ticgeo3d/tree/95252ebc4a37db63d37e5f86c050106e1d829149

I have struggled greatly with understanding how btco's FPS entirely functions, and also at replicating it. I'm setting their method of 3D Projection aside for now. I found another TIC project called Raycast Racer, and it uses ttri (Triangle Rendering), so I'm thinking that's the route to take this.
